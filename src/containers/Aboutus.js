      Dogs were probably the first tame animals. They have accompanied humans
      for at least 20,000 years and possibly as many as 40,000. Scientists
      generally agree that all dogs, domestic and wild, share a common wolf
      ancestor; at some point grey wolves and dogs went on their separate
      evolutionary ways. Dog Breeds Today humans have bred hundreds of different
      domestic dog breeds—some of which could never survive in the wild. Despite
      their many shapes and sizes all domestic dogs, from Newfoundlands to pugs,
      are members of the same species—Canis familiaris. Although they have
      domestic temperaments, dogs are related to wolves, foxes, and jackals.
      Similarities to Wild Relatives Domestic dogs still share many behaviors
      with their wild relatives. Both defend their territories and mark them by
      urinating on trees, rocks, fence posts, and other suitable sites. These
      scent posts serve notice to other dogs that an animal is occupying its
      territory. Many pet dogs also bury bones or favorite toys for future use,
      just as their wild relatives sometimes bury a kill to secure the meat for
      later feasts. Communication Dogs communicate in several ways. Scent is one
      method, another is physical appearance. Body position, movement, and
      facial expression often convey a strong message. Many of these signals are
      recognizable even to humans, such as the excited tail-wagging of a happy
      dog or the bared teeth of an angry or threatened animal. Vocally, dogs
      communicate with a cacophony of sounds including barks, growls, and
      whines. Working Dogs Domestic dogs serve as more than companions; many
      earn their keep by working hard. Dogs herd livestock, aid hunters, guard
      homes, and perform police and rescue work. Some special animals even guide
      the blind—a poignant symbol of the dog's longstanding role as man's best
      friend.
